# Contributing To "Becoming A JS Developer" #

Hi, I'm assuming since you're here, you want to add, remove, or fix something in this repo. Thank you!

Though this repo is fairly informal, I feel it's important to outline what makes a good contribution. I hope this helps you better understand what this repo is all about and how to make the best of your effort.

1. "Becoming a JS Developer" is focused, first, on JavaScript development. If your resource is language specific and not centered around JavaScript development, it might not be a fit. There are cases where this does not hold. The cases where another language is acceptable are as follows:
    - The resource is so well known and well understood that it could be considered a "classic" resource (e.g. the book "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler)
    - The resource has no JavaScript analog, and the core content adds novel value even outside of the original language
2. Some development resources are language agnostic. Examples are version control, agile software development, etc. Any of these are worth considering as an addition.

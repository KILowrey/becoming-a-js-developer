# Becoming a Javascript Developer #

This project started out as a couple of quick references to common things people who are learning Javascript in one of my classes might want to know. Now this project is a work in process capturing a collection of examples, cheat sheets, common job requirements, tools to improve learning, and more.

This is not a blog, instead it is a repository for "other things," whatever that might mean. Hopefully you will find this useful, even if you are not aiming to become a Javascript developer in particular.

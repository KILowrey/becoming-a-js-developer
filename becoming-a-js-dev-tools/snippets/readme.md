# Visual Studio Code JavaScript Snippets #

The JSON files included in this directory are code snippets which are intended to help you automate the development process and focus more energy on what you care about right now -- solving this darn problem.

Snippets are a way, in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), to generate code with a few keystrokes. By installing these custom snippets, you will get common boilerplate for JQuery, Express, Mocha, Chai, and Inquirer. This list may be a subset of the snippets included in the files, but the idea remains the same.

## Installation ##

To install these snippets in VS Code, first, you must have [VS Code installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE** These instructions are written for someone who has not created or installed any user snippets before. If you have done such a thing, be sure not to accidentally delete work you have done previously.

Next, press the F1 key to open the command menu. Follow these steps for JavaScript:

1. Type "Configure User Snippets" and select the first item in the menu
2. Once the dialog changes, type JavaScript and select the first item on the menu
   1. a file will open
3. Delete the contents of the file which just opened
4. Copy every single line and character in the `javascript.json` file in this project (same folder this file is in)
5. Paste everything you copied into the file you just emptied.

The `json.json` file can be installed in a similar fashion. Instead of searching for JavaScript, search for JSON.

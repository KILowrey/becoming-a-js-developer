# CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) #

CRUD is the most common operations done on data from an application. Whether you're working with a file on disc, or a database somewhere in the cloud, some of the most important day-to-day work you'll do will be create, read, update, and delete.

Below is a table of how CRUD maps to a variety of scenarios:

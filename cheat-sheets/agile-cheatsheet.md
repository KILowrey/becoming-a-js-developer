# Agile Cheat Sheet #

## The Agile Manifesto ##

The Agile Manifesto is a philosophy and working agreement made by a group of developers in 2001. It goes as follows:

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Modern Agile ##

The Modern Agile framework was developed by Joshua Kerievsky and a group of other developers as an answer to the challenges which have arisen since the original Agile Manifesto was written:

- Make people awesome
- Make safety a prerequisite
- Experiment and learn rapidly
- Deliver value continuously

## Agile Frameworks ##

Agile frameworks are systems which attempt to capture the intent and nature of the Agile Manifesto while also answering common business questions.  Four common frameworks are the following:

- Kanban
- LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)
- SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
- Scrum

## Agile Practices ##

Several practices have arisen around agile software development. Below is a (non-comprehensive) list of practices people often employ throughout their day:

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Pair Programming
    - Driver/Navigator
    - Ping-Pong Pairing
    - Code Cooking
- Mob Programming
- Refactoring
- Stand-Up
- Code Smells (identifying and eliminating)
- Retrospectives
- Planning Poker
- Backlogs and Backlog Grooming
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Extreme Programming (XP) -- the core is as follows:
    - Test-Driven Development
    - Pair Programming
    - Refactoring
    - Simple Design

## Common Positions in Agile Software Development ##

- Coach
- Customer
- Developer
- Mentor
- Product Owner
- Project Manager
- Scrum Master

## Common Terms ##

- Cadence -- How often something is done
- Burndown -- Actual work done as compared against expected work
- Estimate -- A value representing amount or complexity of work to be done; common sizing:
    - story points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
    - t-shirt sizes (s, m, l, xl)

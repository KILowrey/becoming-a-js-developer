**Working Introduction**

This is a brief history of modern computer programming. As such, I have intentionally omitted topics and people before Charles Babbage. This is not intended to be a fully authored work. Instead my goal is to collect up salient points in the timeline and present links which can lead people to a deeper understanding and discovery.

I do not consider this a completed work, and I would love to have input from the broader community. I am most interested in placing information within the scope of history, and would rather focus on people and historic context than deep technical topics. Nothing in this work is intended to be exhaustive.

# Programmer Slang #

- **Call Your Shot**
  - Before running the problem describe what you expect to happen. 
- **Code by Intention**
  - Writing code as if varibles and functions exist which currently do not
  - Getting to the next error as quickly as possible
- **Defactor (Opposite of Refactor)**
  - Reducing clarity, or otherwise making a program harder to read and maintain (while keeping behavior the same)
- **Tersify**
  - Shortened, probably unnecessarily, likely harder to read and understand (see defactor)
- **YAGNI**
  - You ain't gonna need it -- writing code or integrating tools in anticipation of something which will likely never happen
- **Yak Shaving**
  - Doing 'a', so you can do 'b', so you can do 'c', so you can do 'd', so you can ... so you can do the thing you wanted to do in the first place.
